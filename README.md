# VSCode Dev Container
--------------------

A simple repo to capture <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial>
while I make it into a daily tool, or at least start the attempt.

Lets start for practice by using <https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/installing-hashicorp-tools-in-alpine-linux-containers> as our sample implementation. I know there is a sample Terraform container, but where is the fun in that <https://github.com/devcontainers-contrib/templates/tree/main/src/terraform-basic>. But we are going to copy some code from it.
